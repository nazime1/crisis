# RTools  

This will be an open source RCOS project: a website that houses various course tools for my college, RPI.  
From highest priority to lowest this would include:  
Course descriptions, prerequisites, cross-listings, transfer options by course, the course time/location/professor that semester, major/dual major curriculum by year, a HASS pathways planner, and possibly even a course scheduler if one of the RCOS scheduler projects wishes to collaborate.

Tentative format: static client-side web-service  
Languages/Frameworks: HTML/CSS, TypeScript, React, Node (TBD)  

Lead: Trevor Brunette  
Members: Colin Melville
