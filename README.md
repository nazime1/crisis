# RTools

This will be an open source RCOS project: a website that houses various course tools for my college, RPI. 
From highest priority to lowest this would include: 
course descriptions, prerequisites, cross-listings, which classes from other universities transfer to a course, the time/location/professor for each course that semester, major/dual major curriculum by year, a HASS pathways planner, and possibly even a course scheduler if one of the RCOS scheduler projects wishes to collaborate.

Tentative format: static client-side web-service
Languages/Frameworks: HTML/CSS, TypeScript, React, Node (TBD)

Lead: Trevor Brunette
