# RTools  

RTools is an open source RCOS project: a website that houses various course and major related tools for my college, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  
From the highest priority to lowest this would include:  
Course descriptions, prerequisites, cross-listings, transfer options by course, the course time/location/professor that semester, 
major/dual major curriculum by year, a HASS pathways planner, and possibly even a course scheduler if one of the RCOS scheduler projects wishes to collaborate.

Format: static website  
Stacks: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Node
